# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects implemented using various models and techniques. Each project is organized in its own directory and includes code, datasets (or links to them), training scripts, evaluation metrics, and results.

## Projects Overview

* **Linear Regression:** Predicting continuous values from datasets using simple linear models.
* **Decision Tree Classifier:** Training and visualizing decision trees for classification tasks.
* **CNN Image Classification:** Using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify images (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST).
* **YOLOv5 Object Detection:** Real-time object detection using YOLOv5, including dataset preparation and model fine-tuning.

Each folder includes:

*  A brief description in a `README.md`
*  Training and evaluation code
*  Performance metrics and plots
*  Dataset or dataset loading scripts

##  Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch (depending on the model)
* See individual project folders for specific requirements
